# 8/16 Bit CPU Info

This repo contains CPU usage charts and and opcode spreadsheets for a few
popular CPUs from the 1980's/early 1990's.

Note also that these charts/spreadsheets can also be used for "modern"
retrocomputers (AgonLight, Neo6502, etc.).


## Color Key for the CPU Charts and Spreadsheets
